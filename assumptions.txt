Created a module for repo, that includes defaults for standardisation

Private by default for repos for security reasons

Enabling issues, projects, discussions and wiki by default but allowing override to disable

Owner at repo level means admin

Read only at repo level means pull

State is currently just on local machine, however you would want to enable remote state and push somewhere like S3 and use DynamoDB for locking

Auth sorted by personal access token and stored in local env variables

To add new users to a team or the organization they would be added into the relevant list (backend_team_members or frontend_team_members) in the teams.tf file

2 accounts added for testing (holifieldheights and mholifield-test-account01) once a terraform apply has been run, users will be required to accept an invitation to join the organization

To add a new repo add a block similar to that already created for existing repos

Currently run local, so terraform init then terraform plan and terraform apply





Further iterations and improvements (time allowing)

Wrap up permissions inside the repo_module

Publish terraform module to an artifact store

Add deployments on push to main (github actions or alike)
